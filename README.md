## Problem Statement

The aim of this project is to create a new and improved Kidney Donor Risk Index by:
 - Eliminating the race-adjustment for Black kidney donors
 - Redefining graft failure
 - Utilizing a combination of novel machine learning techniques to isolate important predictive variables and improve predictive accuracy



## Background
The Kidney Donor Risk Index is a prognostic algorithm developed by Rao et al. (2009) and used by physicians to aid in making decisions regarding kidney allocation for transplants.<sup>[1](https://journals.lww.com/transplantjournal/Fulltext/2009/07270/A_Comprehensive_Risk_Quantification_Score_for.13.aspx)</sup> The original paper utilized Cox Regression to model the risk of graft failure or death with 69,440 transplant records from first-time, kidney-only, deceased donor adult transplants occurring between 1995-2005.<sup>[1](https://journals.lww.com/transplantjournal/Fulltext/2009/07270/A_Comprehensive_Risk_Quantification_Score_for.13.aspx)</sup> 





## Research



## Data

As per the Organ Transplantation and Procurement Network (OPTN), "STAR (Standard Transplant Analysis and Research) files are limited datasets that contain patient-level information about transplant recipients, deceased and living donors, and waiting list candidates back to 10/1/1987." 

In accordance with the OPTN Data Use Agreement, the de-identified patient-level data contained in the STAR files used in the subsequent analysis and modeling are not available in this repository. You may request the data [here](https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/request-data/data-request-instructions/).
