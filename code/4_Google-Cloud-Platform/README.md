# Google Cloud AI Platform Custom Training
## Folders

### training_job_folder
Contains all files (excluding data) used to prepare the custom training package. I used the [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/training/docs/hyperparameter-tuning-overview) and tips from this [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/hyperparameter-tuning-on-google-cloud-platform-with-scikit-learn-7d6155195efb) to prepare my custom training package. 

### trained_model
Folder downloaded from GCP AI Platform after custom training job completed.
